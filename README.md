This repo holds the analysis made on Chlorophyll concentrations in the San Francisco Bay from 2014 to 2018. Data was provided by USGS. Datasets were transformed to a workable dataframe and the process was recorded in the cleaned_waterQ.ipynb file, while the actual analysis can be found in the analysis.ipynb file.
